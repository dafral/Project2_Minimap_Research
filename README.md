# Mini-map
The mini-map is a constant in modern video games. If you do not know where to go, just look in the corner of your screen and you have an idea of your surroundings and now know where to go. Let's take a look in what a mini-map is and what are they used for:

## What is a mini-map?

A mini-map (it can be also called radar screen) is a miniature map that is often placed at a screen corner in video games to aid players in orienting themselves within the game world. They are often only a small portion of the screen and thus must be selective in what details they display. Elements usually included on mini-maps vary by video game genre. However, Because the mini-map must be small (usually 5 to 10 percent of the screen area), it shows only major geographic features and minimal non-missions-critical data. Key characters or buildings usually appear in the mini-map. Spots that are not visible in the world they shouldn't be visible in the mini-map either.

A mini-map helps the player orient himself and warn him of challenges not visible in the main view, such as nearby enemies in a strategy or action game or a problem developing in a construction and management simulation. Mini-maps typically show up in a corner of the screen. You can find them in virtually any game: sport games, shooters, strategy games, RPG, racing games...

## A bit of history
The first mini-maps in videogames history can be found in arcade games. Some examples are Rally-X by Namco in 1980 (first image) and Defender by Williams Electronics in 1981 (second image). The utility of the mini-map at the beginning was to help the player and to make the game more fair. Imagine playing Rally-X without knowing where the enemies are going to pop up!

The mini-map was also a particularly desirable feature in dungeon crawls, which typically featured a dungeon with many levels for players to explore. Before automapping, players were expected to draw maps by hand as they played the game, so they could navigate through the dungeon levels later. For this reason, game boxes for early 1980s Wizardry games, for example, included graph paper.

Since then, the mini-map has been conquering more and more genres and games, and nowadays we can found them in almost every genre. Mini-maps have become very common specially in real-time strategy and MMORPG video games because they serve as an indication of where the current screen lies within the scope of the game world. Most first person shooter games also have some version or variant of the mini map, often showing enemies in real time.

## Types of mini-maps
Designers generally use one of two display conventions:

- **The world-oriented map.** It displays the entire game world with north at the top just like a paper map, regardless of the main view's current orientation. An indicator withing the mini-map marks that part of the game world currently visible in the main view. Usually a square in the mini-map represents the portion of the world that the player is seeing in the screen. In a multipresent game, you can use the world-oriented map as a camera control device: If the player clicks the map, the camera jumps to the location clicked.

- **The character-oriented map.** It displays the game world around the avatar, placing him at the center of the map facing the top of the screen. If the player turns turns the avatar to face in a new direction in the game world, the landscape, rather than the avatar, rotates in the map. These mini-maps don't show the whole game world, only a limited area around the avatar, and as the avatar moves, they change accordingly. They are often round and for this reason are sometimes called radar screens. Because the landscape rotates in the map, sometimes character-oriented mini-maps include an indicator pointing north, making the map double as a compass.

#### So... mini-map looks like a very important feature, all the games should have it, right?
No! The inclusion of the mini-map is a game dessign decision.
