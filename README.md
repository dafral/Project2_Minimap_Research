# Minimap
The Mini Map is a constant in modern video games. If you do not know where to go, just look in the corner of your screen and you have an idea of your surroundings and now know where to go. Let's take a look in what a minimap is and what are they used for:

## What is a minimap?

A minimap is a miniature map that is often placed at a screen corner in video games to aid players in orienting themselves within the game world. They are often only a small portion of the screen and thus must be selective in what details they display. Elements usually included on Mini-maps vary by video game genre. However, commonly included features are the position of the player character, allied units or structures, enemies, objectives and surrounding terrain.

#### So... minimap looks like a very important feature, all the games should have it, right?
No! The inclusion of the minimap is a game dessign decision.
