# **MINI-MAP**
The mini-map is a constant in modern video games. If you do not know where to go, just look in the corner of your screen and you have an idea of your surroundings and now know where to go. Let's take a look in what a mini-map is and what are they used for:


## What is a mini-map?

A mini-map (it can be also called radar screen) is a miniature map that is often placed at a screen corner in video games to aid players in orienting themselves within the game world. They are often only a small portion of the screen and thus must be selective in what details they display. Elements usually included on mini-maps vary by video game genre. However, Because the mini-map must be small (usually 5 to 10 percent of the screen area), it shows only major geographic features and minimal non-missions-critical data. Key characters or buildings usually appear in the mini-map. Spots that are not visible in the world they shouldn't be visible in the mini-map either.

A mini-map helps the player orient himself and warn him of challenges not visible in the main view, such as nearby enemies in a strategy or action game or a problem developing in a construction and management simulation. Mini-maps typically show up in a corner of the screen. You can find them in virtually any game: sport games, shooters, strategy games, RPG, racing games...

## A bit of history
The first mini-maps in videogames history can be found in arcade games. Some examples are Rally-X by Namco in 1980 (first image) and Defender by Williams Electronics in 1981 (second image). The utility of the mini-map at the beginning was to help the player and to make the game more fair. Imagine playing Rally-X without knowing where the enemies are going to pop up!

The mini-map was also a particularly desirable feature in dungeon crawls, which typically featured a dungeon with many levels for players to explore. Before automapping, players were expected to draw maps by hand as they played the game, so they could navigate through the dungeon levels later. For this reason, game boxes for early 1980s Wizardry games, for example, included graph paper.

Since then, the mini-map has been conquering more and more genres and games, and nowadays we can found them in almost every genre. Mini-maps have become very common specially in real-time strategy and MMORPG video games because they serve as an indication of where the current screen lies within the scope of the game world. Most first person shooter games also have some version or variant of the mini map, often showing enemies in real time.

## Diferences in mini-maps

### Types of mini-maps
Designers generally use one of two display conventions:

- **The world-oriented map.** It displays the entire game world with north at the top just like a paper map, regardless of the main view's current orientation. An indicator withing the mini-map marks that part of the game world currently visible in the main view. Usually a square in the mini-map represents the portion of the world that the player is seeing in the screen. In a multipresent game, you can use the world-oriented map as a camera control device: If the player clicks the map, the camera jumps to the location clicked.

- **The character-oriented map.** It displays the game world around the avatar, placing him at the center of the map facing the top of the screen. If the player turns turns the avatar to face in a new direction in the game world, the landscape, rather than the avatar, rotates in the map. These mini-maps don't show the whole game world, only a limited area around the avatar, and as the avatar moves, they change accordingly. They are often round and for this reason are sometimes called radar screens. Because the landscape rotates in the map, sometimes character-oriented mini-maps include an indicator pointing north, making the map double as a compass.

### Features

- **Automapping.** It is a mini-map that is mainly used as a navigational aid for virtual worlds that are expansive or maze-like. An automap is typically an abstract top-down view of nearby areas of the game world and it automatically updates as the player character gains knowledge of the environment. Automaps often display traversable terrain, allies, enemies, and important locations or items.

- **Fog of War.** In many games using a mini-map, the mini-map begins completely blank, while the map is automatically drawn as the player discovers new areas of the game world. After players discover new areas, the terrain of the discovered area often remains visible on the mini-map. If the player's characters or units cease being able to see the area, the area might be covered by a fog of war, so that unit or structure movements in that area will not be shown. Things in a fog of war portion of a mini-map may not be updated until they are rediscovered.

## Pros & Cons of mini-maps

#### So... mini-map looks like a very important feature, all the games should have it, right?

No! The inclusion of the mini-map is a game dessign decision. Some games that have been very succesful between video game players have no minimap.

There are some pros and cons we should keep in mind before deciding if we want a minimap in our game:

### Pros 
The player usually don't like to remember things while he is playing, imagine if he would have to remember the whole map! Thanks to the mini-map we can show the player how the map looks in every moment. Also it's easier to make the player notice the changes in the map. This changes doesn't have to be geographic, but can be enemies approaching the player position. Without these alerts the player could feel frustrated of unfair challenges.

It also makes the game more accesible and more direct. Players that are not looking for a rough challenge are more likely to enjoy the game, or even people that are younger that usually have more difficulties retaining information. Also the player can focus in another game aspects, like how to improve his skills.

### Cons
So, what would be a possible draw back to having a mini map in a game? An argument that has surfaced among people who play games with a mini map is that it takes a sort of realism out of the game. It is obviously not realistic to have a constant map that that tracks your every location out at all times. Constantly updating as you are running around a giant world. It also distracts you for the action in the screen. 

Another comment against the mini map is that it makes the game too easy. A common argument against games today is that they do not challenge the player as much as games of old did. The mini map now makes the exploration that was needed in old games non-existent. Some indie games that really want to emulate the old days usually put away the map to emulate better the experience of the exploration.

## Advices to make a great mini-map

Designing a mini-map can be easy, but designing a mini-map that suits the game, helps the player and succeeds in its objective can be more challenging. Here you can find some easy advices that will help you accomplishing this:

- **Choose a suitable size**. Make your map large enough to be legible, but not so big that it fills up the whole screen. If you must have the map fill up the whole screen, do your players a favor and pause the gameplay.

- **Make it handy**. Make it easy for players to move/travel and look at the map at the same time. It's too much of a chore to open a map, memorize the locations, and then close the map to return to the game.

- **Every element in your mini-map should be identifiable**. Create a legend to help if you need it. Players should be able to find checkpoints, doorways, quests, items, traversal goals or story points in your mini-map, and be able to see the difference betwee them.

- **Indicate changes in elevation if you have them in yourt game**. Players can be very confused when dealing with levels with multiple elevations. A color code or an "onion skin" effect can could help to deal with.

- **Show player's direction**. If you are using a character-oriented map you can rotate all the map, but if it's not the case, at least represent the player with an arrow pointing where he is looking at.

- **Add relevant information that can help the players**. Metal Gear Solid shows the vision cones of the soldiers, Fallout shows the distance in meters between you and the point you marked... If you think the players should know some extra information, show them.

## HOW A MINIMAP WORKS
Okay, now we know how to design a mini-map and when we should implement it. But what about the coding part? How we code a mini-map. Well we have to understand first how a mini-map works. 

First of all, we have to understand that as the name mini-map says, a mini-map is the small version of our world map. That means there will be a relation in the proportions of both maps. This relation will dictate everything: the distance before entities, the size of the screen, the size of buildings... What we need to do is to translate all this world data to mini-map data.

![Image](http://i.imgur.com/pXXRpll.png)

For example let's imagine our world is 100 x 100 pixels and we want to do a minimap that is 10 x 10 pixels. Here the ratio would be 1/10. That means that everything will have in order to go from the world to the mini-map will have to be divided by 10. So a unit placed in the pixel 80 x 50 should be shown in the pixel 8 x 5 of our mini-map. 

## Exercise
Let's see if you have understood everything. There is a downloable exercise you can use to see if you have. In this exercise we will make a very simple isometric mini-map to a simple aplication. Along the code you will find some missing parts of the code that you have to fill with what you think is correct. These blank spaces are marked as TODOs in the code. Let's see what you should do in each TODO to have your mini-map fully working:

### TODO 1
First of all you have to load the mini-map atlas. All the sprites we are going to use for the mini-map should be there. For this exercise use the atlas provided in the folder maps, inside the data zip. Don't forget to call it after that!

### TODO 2
Now get all the useful information of the real world map. The information we need is the position and the id. The id will tell us which sprite we should use from our mini-map atlas. Store everything in the "mini_tiles" vector. Look up the struct "minimap_tiles" so you can understand what it's inside of the vector.

### TODO 3
Let's draw now the minimap. First of all we should draw the terrain. You have all the information in a vector so it should be easy to do that. Use the Blit function from the render to do this. 

Remember we have to translate all the coordinates to our mini-map. Choose a ratio you think it fits and doesn't look weird.

All the SDL_Rects are already created, they are called green, blue, yellow and red.

### TODO 4
Now let's draw the units. First the allies. Remember the position of the units should have the same relation betweem world map coords and mini-map coords.

### TODO 5
Do the same with the enemy units. Change the color so you can differentiate them.

### TODO 6
